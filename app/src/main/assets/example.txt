Have you ever tried to communicate with someone you cannot understand? There are many ways that we can understand another person. But to know them the best, attempting to share a language can be a great way to truly understanding somebody, and a direct route to their heart. It can also be an incredible way to further yourself as a human being, and it can create much more empathy within us as people. We can experience an absolute shift in our emotional range, when our horizons expand through new languages. 
Understanding another’s culture means understanding each other as an entire race – the human kind.
